## Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages
### Compiled Laguanges
They are the ones that take the sytax from the programmer and translate the syntax into machine code creating a new file ready to be executed and when this code has a new change the whole code has to be compiled again, these kind of laguages are usually faster and more efficient than interpreted languages because we can say the process is direct. One disadvantage is that compiled languages are not multi-platform some examples could be C++, C, Go etc.

### Interpreted Languages
They are the ones that are run by a text editor and executed line by line so they are more dinamic in the way of making changes on the program but as this process seems diligent they are less efficient and slower to compiled languages. One advantage can be they are multi-platform some examples could be Javascript, Python, Ruby etc.

## Is Java compiled, interpreted or both?

This is a good question because there are not only two types of programming languages, there is one more that are called hybrid laguages and Java is one of them, in this case Java compiles the code through the Java compiler to get bytecode and the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) executes it, but there is also an implementation of JVM that interprets the code instead of compiling it.

## Pseudocode Currency Converter
The next code converts dollars into bitcoins:


```
1. START 
2. Bitcoin <-- 0.000043 (bitcoin value on 20/07/2022 4:00 PM CST)
3. Dollars <-- GET
4. x <-- Bitcoin*Dollars
5. PRINT x
6. END
```
